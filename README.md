### 🤖 Professional AI Babysitter

> *"The models type, I debug and complain."*

#### About Me

- 🔭 Currently mass-producing side projects at an alarming rate
- 🧠 4 months deep into AI-assisted development (send help)
- 🛠️ I don't write code anymore — I write prompts and fix what comes back
- 💬 Ask me about... actually, ask my AI. It knows more.
- 📍 Somewhere between Stack Overflow and ChatGPT

---

#### My Development Workflow

```
1. Write a prompt
2. Get code back
3. It doesn't work
4. Debug for 3 hours
5. Realize the AI was right and I was wrong
6. Repeat
```
